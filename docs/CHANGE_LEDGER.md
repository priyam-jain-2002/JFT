# Change Ledger

This append-only ledger records meaningful repository changes. Newest entries go first; existing historical entries remain intact.

## 2026-10-14 — Initialize repository governance

- **Changed:** Added the agent operating guide, project README, Git ignore rules, full and compact decision logs, phase checklist, research location, and ledger.
- **Why:** Establish durable project practices for research, product work, development, validation, risk escalation, decisions, and progress tracking before implementation begins.
- **Validation:** Confirmed all governance files exist, link to one another, use consistent decision IDs/statuses, and preserve the read-only `sources/` boundary.
- **Related:** DEC-2026-001, DEC-2026-002; Phase 0.
- **Follow-up:** Complete Phase 1 discovery and research.
